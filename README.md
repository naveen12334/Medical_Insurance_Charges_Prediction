# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The goal of this project is to allows a person to get an idea about the necessary amount required according to their own health status. Later they can comply with any health insurance company and their schemes & benefits keeping in mind the predicted amount from our project. This can help a person in focusing more on the health aspect of an insurance rather than the futile part

# Goal:
the goal is to predict the insurance charges of the Customers of Healthcare Service according to the provided dataset based on the age,gender,bmi etc.

# Approach:
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

# Project Various Steps:

# Data Source (SQL VM):

# Data Transformation and Extraction:
Data is transformed into SQL Server from csv files and extract in python notebook from SQL Server through making a connection with pyodbc library.

# Data Exploration:
I started exploring datasets using pandas, NumPy,matplotlib and seaborn.

# Model Selection:
Made many Models But selected RandomForest Regressor.

# Hyperparameter Optimization:
Using Randomizedsearch CV to select the best parameter for training the model

# Model Dump:
As per selected trained model is dumped to pickled format for app development

# Model Accuracy 
# Training : 90%
# Testing  : 88%

# Export data with predicted result back to SQL Server:
